# Song Timer
A purely client song/map timer app.

## What is this?
With this app you can time your songs/maps and export them with silence at the start to align the beat. It was mainly designed for making Beatsaber maps, but it can also be used for other rythm games.

## Future Ideas
* Exporting to .ogg
* Adding a guided mode that walks you through step by step
* Adding auto bpm and offset detection
